This is the codebook of the run_analysis.R script written for tidying the data set "Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions Data Set". For more info about the dataset here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
			  

1. Downloading data from a url and unzipping the zip file
	- url: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
	- data set: Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions Data Set

2. Reading in data using data.table and assigning data from each file to a variable
	- features: UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt (List of all features)
	- activities: UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt (Links the class labels with their activity name) 
	- train_subjects: UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt (Training subjects)
	- test_subjects: UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt (Test subjects)
	- train_data: UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt (Training set)
	- test_data: UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt (Test set)
	- train_data_labels: UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt (Training labels)
	- test_data_labels: UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt (Test labels)

3. Merging training and test datasets to create one dataset
	- using bind_rows and bind_cols from dplyr to merge training and test datasets	
	  and then saving the data in the following variables
	- data: row_binding train_data and test_data
	- subjects: row_binding train_subjects and train_subjects
	- labels: row_binding train_data_labels and test_data_labels
	- data_set: col_binding subjects, data and labels (#rows: 10299	#cols: 563)

4. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
	- extracting only mean and std for each subject and activitiy using select from dplyr
	- saving the selected data in mean_std_data

5. Replacing the activity codes in the mean_std_data set with descriptive activity names as defined in the activities data set using gsub and mutate funcations
         activity code    activities (replacements)
  	 1           	  WALKING
   	 2   		  WALKING_UPSTAIRS
   	 3         	  WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
   	 4          	  SITTING
   	 5           	  STANDING
   	 6             	  LAYING

6. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names using gsub
	 pattern          replacement
  	 Code             activities
   	 Acc  	          Accelerometer
   	 Gyro        	  Gyroscope
   	 Mag          	  Magnitude
   	 BodyBody         Body
   	 ^f (starting f)  Frequency
	 ^t (starting t)  Time
7. From the data set mean_std_data, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject and saving it in a file named tidy_data.txt using group_by and summarize_all and write.table for saving it in a text file. dims of tidy_data: 180  88
