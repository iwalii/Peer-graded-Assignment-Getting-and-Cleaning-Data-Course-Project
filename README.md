    This is the codebook of the run_analysis.R script written for tidying the data set "Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions Data Set". For more info about the dataset here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
    
    run_analysis.R
    The script for getting from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" to the tidy_dataset.txt
    1- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    3- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    5- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    6- Exports the dataset from setp 5 to the file tidy_dataset.txt
